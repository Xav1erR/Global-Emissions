Global Emissions Graph(Worldwide) and predicting the future
The problem of predicting future CO2 emissions is important because it is crucial to
understand how human activities and natural phenomena contribute to climate change.
CO2 emissions are a major driver of global warming and climate change, and
understanding their future trajectory is critical for policymakers to make informed
decisions about how to mitigate their impact. Accurately predicting future CO2 emissions
can also help individuals and businesses make more informed decisions about their
energy use and carbon footprint. Furthermore, such predictions can inform the
development of new technologies and policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and
mitigating the impacts of climate change.
